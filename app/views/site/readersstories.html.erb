				<h3>Readers' Stories</h3>
				<p>Many invited me to their church or their civic group to share the message of believing in ourselves and in something bigger. In each city, I met people trusting their own whispers and Doing Good. Some dreams were as big as a building and others were making a difference one life at a time. Meeting these inspiring people and finding out was calling them is part of my next chapter. Here are a few of the many I have met. If you know someone who has listened to their whisper to find their calling let me know about it. Email me their (or your) photo and story: <a href="mailto:kathy.izard@gmail.com?subject:Readers Stories" class="button lblue">Email Kathy</a></p>

							<p>&quot; As her colleague, I knew Kathy as a force of passion and know-how. When Kathy said she wanted to help Urban Ministry Center create housing, we let out a collective sigh of relief. We had no doubt that she could get it done. Reading the story of her own doubts in herself and the project along the way was a beautiful reminder that courage is not the absence of fear, but rather the willingness to persist in the face of fear.&quot;</p>

<!-- 						<h3>Kathy is a force of nature</h3>
 -->				
				<p>&quot;To say that she literally breathed Moore Place into reality would not be an inaccurate decription, except that it undercuts her long days and nights of blood, sweat, and tears. In 2008 &amp; 2009, no one in this community was talking about &quot;housing first&quot; or even simply--real housing--as the solution to homelessness. Kathy was often a one-woman band, armed with determination, data, and a dogged belief that Moore Place could--and world--transform lives and the community.&quot;</p>
