					<h1>Trust the Whisper</h1>
					<p><em>The Hundred Story Home</em> leads you on an inspirational journey that begins with a question, &quot;Where are the beds&#x3f;&quot; and ends with over one hundred formerly homeless people living in homes of their own.</p>
					<p>Author, Kathy Izard, was enjoying a comfortable existence when she came face to face with the reality that while her dedicated service at the community soup kitchen might be feeding her soul, it would never solve the bigger needs of the homeless population. Confronting the question of where are the beds&#x3f; Kathy realized that she had been called to take on what seemed like an insurmountable task&#xfe58;to build housing for Charlotte&#x27;s homeless.</p><p>Woven together with this uplifting story of a call to social action is Kathy&#x27;s personal struggle with faith, forgiveness and fulfillment. In telling her story, Kathy invites you to consider your rewriting your own. What&#x27;s calling you&#x3f; And as crazy at it seems, it may be crazier not to try.</p>

					<p>&quot;Compelling, inspiring, funny and poignant.... This is a book about finding your purpose in a meaningful life; it&#x27;s about faith and family and friendship. But mostly, it&#x27;s a love story.&quot;</p>

					<p>&quot;I just finished Kathy's book. Once I got into it, I could barely put it down. I thought it was wonderful and I cried all the way through it. I can't wait until this is published because I want to share it with so many people.&quot;</p>

					<p>&quot;In the book, Kathy describes how her father used to say to her &quot; You can do anything, Kathy, really anything. &quot; When you reach the last page of the Hundred Story Home, you completely agree with Kathy's dad-but equally powerfully, through Kathy's example, you believe you can do anything too. The Hundred Story Home leaves the reader inspired, as Gandhi said, to be the change we want to see in the world.&quot;</p>
