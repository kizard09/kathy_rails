							<p>Kathy’s secret weapon is that she is always real, and she is always genuine. She brings an authenticity that stirs checkbooks, yes—but more importantly, stirs hearts and minds to say, “How can I help? I want to be part of that.” With Kathy, the listener is transformed from, “What can be done?” to “We can absolutely do this together.&quot;</p>

						<blockquote>
							<p>In The Hundred Story Home, Kathy could have chosen to simply tell the story of how Moore Place came to be. But by sharing her personal story, particularly being the child of a mother living and struggling with mental illness, she gives her readers—and society as a whole—a tremendous gift. She puts a face on mental illness that is relatable beyond social class, race, and strata. In a world that struggles to understand and talk about mental illness, we need more honest and open dialogue like this.&quot;</p>
