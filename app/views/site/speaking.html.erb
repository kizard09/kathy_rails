							<p>Kathy’s presentation was earnest and bold in reminding our community of the healing power and necessity of housing, especially from the street to housing.I  have received numerous upon numerous compliments regarding both the event and the way that her message has become a “whisper” for some.  The accolades continue to come in!&quot;</p>

						<h6>Rev. Dr. Bruce Spangler, Executive Director<br>Volunteer Ministry Center, 10th Annual Carry the Torch event<br>Knoxville, Tennessee</h6>
					</div>
					<div class="quote-block">
						<blockquote>
							<p>Kathy Izard, kicked off the 2018 Carolina Women’s Leadership Council annual meeting and truly embodied the spirit of the lecture series which is leadership, commitment to public service and a proven ability to exact real, positive change in the community. Her remarks, no doubt inspired the 350 people in attendance—Carolina students, professors, staff, community volunteers and members of the Carolina Women’s Leadership Council -- as she encouraged them to listen to their inner whisper and to act NOW to spark positive change for good.  Kathy is proof positive how one person can make a profound difference in our world. The Carolina campus is still buzzing about her lecture.  What a gift it was to have her on our campus.&quot;</p>

						<h6>Lanier Brown May<br>University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</h6>
					</div>
					<div class="quote-block">
						<blockquote>
							<p>Kathy was our featured speaker at an event for women at our church. She was spectacular! She is inspiring, relatable, and has a very important story to share about choices, “composing” our own lives, listening to God’s voice, and the plight of homeless men, women and children in our midst. Kathy shares her story in a way that is transparent and eminently honest. We laughed, we cried and, perhaps most importantly, we gained insight and energy for our own spiritual paths.&quot;</p>
						</blockquote>
						<h6>The Rev, Jennifer C, Brown<br>Senior Associate Rector, Christ Church, Raleigh</h6>

					<div class="quote-block">
						<blockquote>
							<p>It is hard to put into words how moving, inspiring, and spiritually encouraging Kathy's presentation was. Ten days later I'm still talking about her and getting chills and tears when I think of (our homeless neighbors in) "the bad at night.&quot;</p>
						</blockquote>
						<h6>Nan Revell<br>Sorosis Book community event<br>
Asheboro, NC</h6>
					</div>
					
					<div class="quote-block">
						<blockquote>
							<p>Kathy’s secret weapon is that she is always real, and she is always genuine. She brings an authenticity that stirs checkbooks, yes—but more importantly, stirs hearts and minds to say, “How can I help? I want to be part of that.” With Kathy, the listener is transformed from, “What can be done?” to “We can absolutely do this together.&quot;</p>
						</blockquote>
						<h6>Caroline Chambre Hammock<br>Former Director, Moore Place</h6>
					</div>
					<div class="quote-block">
						<blockquote>
							<p>Kathy Izard has a story that resonates with civic groups as well as church groups. Her listening to an inner voice that led her to develop Moore Place will encourage others to listen harder to find what they can do to better their communities.&quot;</p>
						</blockquote>
						<h6>Denise Ratchford<br>Westminster Presbyterian Church, Charlotte</h6>
					</div> 
					<div class="quote-block">
						<blockquote>
							<p>Kathy’s message was one that deeply resonated with people and motivated them to come and learn more about how they could listen to the voice of God and see where the power of God could change not only their lives but the lives of their community. If you’re considering a speaker on the topic of God’s marvelous grace to change us as individuals and to change our communities, then Kathy Izard is a perfect choice. People in our community are still talking about her and her message. The inspiration has extended far beyond just that Friday evening in March.&quot;</p>
						</blockquote>
						<h6>The Rev. Stephen Setzer<br>Associate Rector, Christ Church Christiana Hundred, Wilmington, DE</h6>
					</div> 
					<div class="quote-block">
						<blockquote>
							<p>The Hundred Story Home is that book.  The book that you can't mention off hand that you can't just hope someone reads. It's the book that deserves to be pressed into someone's hands with a promise to have tea and talk about it. The Hundred Story Home is a book that you'll be pressing it into someone's hands. And Kathy Izard is that speaker who will be pressing into your heart.&quot;</p>
